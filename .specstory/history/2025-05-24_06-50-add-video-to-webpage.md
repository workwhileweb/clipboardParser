I'll help you add a video element to the page. I'll edit the HTML file to include a video element that references the video file at `./video.mp4`.

Let me edit the `index.html` file:


---

```diff
+ <video width="100%" controls>
+   <source src="./video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
+   Your browser does not support the video tag.
+ </video>
+ 
  <div id="OutputLink" ng-class="output ? '' : 'disabled'" class="">
    Drag this link to your bookmarks bar:
```

---

I've added a video element with the following features:
1. Width set to 100% to make it responsive
2. Controls enabled for play/pause/volume
3. Source pointing to `./video.mp4`
4. A fallback message for browsers that don't support the video tag

The video will appear above the existing clipboard parser link. Make sure that the `video.mp4` file exists in the same directory as your `index.html` file. If you need to adjust the video's size or add any additional attributes (like autoplay, loop, etc.), just let me know!
